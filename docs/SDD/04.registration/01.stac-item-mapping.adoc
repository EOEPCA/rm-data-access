= STAC Item mapping

When the registration is triggered with a path to a directory (or Object Storage prefix) containing a `collection.json`, the STAC Item registration scheme in the registrar will recursively discover all contained `collection.json` files and ultimately all referenced STAC Items.

For each such discovered item, the registration into the data access and resource catalogue components is started.

== STAC Item registration into the data access component

When ingesting a STAC item into the data access component the following steps will be taken:

1. A suitable `ProductType` will be queried. This is done using the STAC Items assets with their respective `eo:bands` list. Here, the `name` attribute will be used as a lookup and the `ProductType` with matching `CoverageType` field names will be used. If no suitable `ProductType` was found, a new one will be created. See the Section ... for how exactly this `ProductType` is created.
2. A new `Product` will be created and associated with the fetched or created `ProductType` from step 1. Its unique identifier is taken from the `id` attribute of the STAC Item. If there already is a `Product` with that identifier, it is either replaced or the registration process aborts, depending on the configuration.
In this step, also the product metadata is extracted. The STAC Item's `geometry` is used as the `footprint`, whereas either the `datetime` or the `start_datetime`/`end_datetime` will be used as the temporal extent.
3. For each `CoverageType` in the used `ProductType` the related asset is extracted and registered as a `Coverage` associated with the `CoverageType` and the `Product` from earlier.
4. Collection placement TBD

== `ProductType` creation

=== `CoverageType` setup

Each asset that provides the `eo:bands` metadata will be added as a `CoverageType`. The `CoverageType` will be comprised of a `FieldType` for each listed band. Here, the `name` attribute will be used as the identifier and (if present) the `common_name` will be used as the fields `definition`.

=== `BrowseTypes` setup

Depending on the available bands semantics (the `common_name` attribute is used to determine the existence of a certain band) the following `BrowseTypes` will be created for the `ProductType`:

[cols="2,7a,2a"]
|===
| `BrowseType` name | Description                   | Prerequisites
| `TRUE_COLOR`      | RGB true color representation | `red`, `green`, `blue`
| `FALSE_COLOR`     | NirRG false color composite   | `nir`, `red`, `green`
|===

=== STAC Item extension for browse generation

Additionally, the `brow` extension can be used to declare additional `BrowseTypes`. This allows to declare additional color composites or expressions to be added. The following shows an example for a Landsat-8 STAC Item, declaring the `TRUE_COLOR`, `FALSE_COLOR` and `NDVI` representations from the original source data assets.
